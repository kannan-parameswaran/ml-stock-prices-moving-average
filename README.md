# **Moving average with Time Series in Python**

Simple very effective technique in time series, can be used for data preparation, visualization, smoothing, forecasting and making predictions.

In this project, we'll see how to use moving average technique for time series forecasting with Python using stock prices for Apple Inc.(AAPL).

### What You Will build
You will build an Python application that loads AAPL stock prices from Quandl library, sort, filter, plot some graphs and make stock prediction on historical dates.

### What You need

- A favorite text editor
- Python 3.7 or later
- You can also import the code straight into your IDE:
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - Integrated development environment
  - [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) - Interactive environment
  
### How to complete or run this this guide
You can start from scratch and complete each step or you can bypass basic setup steps that are already familiar to you. Either way, you end up with working code.

To start from scratch, move on to Starting with Single Moving Average.
